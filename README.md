msbvar
======

I will try to support the msbvar R package. For the moment I am underqualifed to understand all the things inside it, but will try :) For the moment I have corrected small error in summary.BSVAR function.

You may install package 
```R
require("devtools")
install_github("bdemeshev/msbvar")
```

On macos I need [fortran 4.2 to compile](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-4.2.3.pkg) the package.

Best,
Boris
