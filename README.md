msbvar
======

I will try to support the msbvar R package. For the moment I am underqualifed to understand all the things inside it, but will try :) Just now I have corrected a small error in summary.BSVAR function with absent parameter p.

You may install package using
```R
require("devtools")
install_github("bdemeshev/msbvar")
```

On macos one needs [fortran 4.2](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) to install the package.

Best,

Boris
